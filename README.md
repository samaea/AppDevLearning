# App Dev Learning .NET repo!

This repo contains labs for learning about the basics of app dev on Azure with Microsoft tools from developing a simple cloud native .NET web app, through deploying it to App Service to learning about DevOps practices and tools like devcontainers, CI/CD and GitHub Copilot. It also includes a lab where we set up a low code solution using Logic Apps. 

## Work with GitHub Codespaces

The Environment is already configured to work with Github Codespaces. To start programming just start a new codespace by clicking the green "CODE" button on the top right and you are ready to go, don't need to install anything.
